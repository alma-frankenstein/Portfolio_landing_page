    <p><strong>Background and Hobbies</strong></p>
    <p>Alma Frankenstein has a Bachelor of Science in social work and a Master of Science in systems Science
      from Portland State University. She has spent the pandemic learning to program, reading, worrying,
      getting teargassed, and biking. In normal times she enjoys those same hobbies. Her favorite way to spend 
      a Saturday is to drink too much coffee with a friend, then walk around for hours, talking about
      philosophy and looking for friendly cats to pet.</p>
    <p>Alma is from Chicago. She is <em>very</em> grateful to everyone who pitched in to save
      the Museum of Holography there.</p>
