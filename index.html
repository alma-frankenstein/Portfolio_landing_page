          Bacon Binary</span></a></li>
          <p>This simple website illustrates Lord Francis Bacon's binary cipher. The cipher, created in the
            Elizabethan era, is considered the predecessor of modern computer binary code, and is an early
            example of steganography. 
            The code for encryption and decryption functions on this site is written in Python. 
            The site also uses Flask, Jinja2, and WTForms.</p>

          <p>These are solutions to some of the challenges on the Rosalind bioinformatics website. The challenges themselves,
            as well as the datasets required to solve them, can be found on the

          <p>This program creates bogus therapist statements using Markov chains (a predictive algorithm), with actual
            therapist statements as input data. This program was written in Python.</p>

      <p><strong>Background and Hobbies</strong></p>
      <p>Alma Frankenstein has a Bachelor of Science in social work and a Master of Science in systems Science
        from Portland State University. She has spent the pandemic learning to program, reading, worrying,
        walking, and biking. In normal times she enjoys those same hobbies. Her favorite way to spend 
        a Saturday is to drink too much coffee with a friend, then walk around for hours, talking about
        philosophy and looking for friendly cats to pet.</p>
      <p>Alma is from Chicago. She is <em>very</em> grateful to everyone who pitched in to save
        the Museum of Holography there.</p>
